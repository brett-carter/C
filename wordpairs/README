Word Pairs assignment

discription:
This program will read in groups of two words at a time from a file and concatenating them into one string. It will then add these into a hashtable. Once the file has been read in it will display in order of highest count to lowest count the frequecy of the word pairs.

Files:
hashtable.c
hashtable.h
main.c
getWord.c
Makefile
README

Errors:
My program still seg. faults at this point. The hashtable works properly. The issue now is creating the Node* array and getting at the count of each and comparing them with qsort.
